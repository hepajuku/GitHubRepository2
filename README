Maven Vaadin framework project
------------------------------

Project is a web application that asks users first name, last name, gender and why are you applying to this job? After writin asked information user presses "Send" button and application sends data to postgreSQL database.
Web application should look like this:

First name
________________
|              |
|______________|
Last name
________________
|              |
|______________|
Gender
O Male
O Female
Why are you applying to this job?

Compiling maven project:
------------------------

Install maven with instructions found at http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.
Download project from GitHub with Git Shell. In Git shell go for example to directory c:\repo and use command "git clone git://github.com/hepajuku/GitHubRepository2.git".
Open commandline cmd.exe and navigate to c:\repo\GitHubRepository2 and use command "mvn install" to build project. After building use command "mvn jetty:run". Open internet browser and go to page http://localhost:8080 to see the result. You can close jetty server by pressing Ctrl+c in commandline and pressing y and enter.

Running like this the application can't connect to a database maybe because jetty can't find a postgreSQL jdbc driver. But you can test that program looks how it should look like.


Running in Tomcat 7
-------------------

You need to download Apache Tomcat 7 from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi. Extract it to some directory for example c:\Tomcat 7\. Then you need to download postgresql jdbc driver from 
http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-9.2-1003.jdbc4.jar and put it to tomcat 7 lib directory for example to c:\tomcat 7\lib directory.

Now go to your repositorys target directory for example c:\repo\GitHubRepository2\target and copy Project-LATEST.war file to your tomcat 7 webapps directory for example c:\tomcat 7\webapps. In commandline navigate to your tomcat bin directory for example c:\tomcat 7\bin and use command "startup" to start tomcat 7 server. Open internet browser and go to page http://localhost:8080/Project-LATEST to see the result. You can close tomcat server by pressing Ctrl+c in Tomcats commandline.

PostgreSQL server requirements
------------------------------

In postgreSQL database you need to have database called mydatabase and there one table called job_applications with columns first_name (character(100 length)), last_name (character(100 length)), gender (character(20 length)) and application (character(1000 length)). You should also make Primary key that uses all columns first_name, last_name, gender and application to maintain data uniqueness. You also need user "admin" as superuser with "1234" password to mydatabase. Easiest way is to use pgAdmin III program to do that.


Application design
------------------

I tried to design application so that vaadin gui, listener, data and sql connection are in different classes.

ProjectUI handles user interface, MyButtonListener gets users inputs from ProjectUI and stores input data to JobApplication and checks if input is ok. Also sends information to database through JobApplication if all is ok. JobApplication stores user inputs and sends data to database in a proper form. SQLConnection makes a connection to database and sends data into it and finally closes the connection.
