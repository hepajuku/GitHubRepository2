Maven Vaadin framework project
------------------------------

Running maven project:

Install maven with instructions found at http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.
Download project from GitHub with Git Shell. In Git shell go for example to directory c:/repo and use command "git clone git://github.com/hepajuku/GitHubRepository2.git".
Open cmd.exe and navigate to c:/repo/GitHubRepository2 and use command "mvn install" to build project. After building use command "mvn jetty:run". Open internet browser and go to page http://localhost:8080 to run program.

This version cant yet connect to database maybe because jetty cant find postgreSQL jdbc driver.
